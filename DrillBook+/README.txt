The app will come with an existing Show called Test Show, for the ease of testing.

Feel free to create new or edit any drill sets and shows.

The Check Drill feature requires that you assign a field to the show. 
- To do this click on the field button and then the add button. Give the field a name. I suggest using either High School or
College so that you can easily identify the field type. Then click the Record button. This will assign your phone's current 
position as 1ft in front of and to the left of the lower left corner of the football field. Tap add when you are done. It will
send you back to the Field table view. Finally, tap on the field you want to assign to the show.

You can now Check Drill which should take your position in relation to the stored field coordinate to see if you are in the 
correct drill position.

The field assigned to a show can be changed. 

Notifications will be posted every drill set change. The user can lock their phone and see the  drill set they were on.
They can swipe left of the notification and then tap the "View" button. 
This will show the drill set with two buttons underneath it.
The "Next" button will advance to the next drill set as long as there is one.
The "Previous" button will go back to the last drill set.
